[Monitoring System with Alarm function based on Sound Detection](https://github.com/cu-ecen-aeld/final-project-vizdr/wiki)



## Project Goals

- Detect sounds which exceed the adjustable threschold and respond using module with LED matrix on Raspberry Pi 4B  board and sensor on Raspberry Pi zero 2 board.


- Enable **communication** using the **CAN protocol** with **RS485 / MCP2515 SPI modules**.


- Control of Sound Sensor and of LED module with **GPIO** on the Raspberry Pi Zero and 4B correspondingly.


- Implement a **state-machine based system** triggered by remote-side sound detection.


- Utilize **Yocto** to generate a lightweight Linux image with integrated kernel drivers and services.
